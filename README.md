 # Choosen Algorithm - Minimum spanning tree - Prim's algorithm

 > Prim's algorithm (also known as Jarn√≠k's algorithm) is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.

```
int n;
vector<vector<int>> adj; // adjacency matrix of graph
const int INF = 1000000000; // weight INF means there is no edge

struct Edge {
    int w = INF, to = -1;
};

void prim() {
    int total_weight = 0;
    vector<bool> selected(n, false);
    vector<Edge> min_e(n);
    min_e[0].w = 0;

    for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) {
        int v = -1;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (!selected[j] && (v == -1 || min_e[j].w < min_e[v].w))
                v = j;
        }

        if (min_e[v].w == INF) {
            cout << "No MST!" << endl;
            exit(0);
        }

        selected[v] = true;
        total_weight += min_e[v].w;
        if (min_e[v].to != -1)
            cout << v << " " << min_e[v].to << endl;

        for (int to = 0; to < n; ++to) {
            if (adj[v][to] < min_e[to].w)
                min_e[to] = {adj[v][to], v};
        }
    }

    cout << total_weight << endl;
