I love watching science fiction movies especially with time dilation ones. My favorite season is fall which I feel exuberant with beautiful colors. I find myslef as an explorer and always like to try new things, meeet new people, visit new places and learn something new. Recently, I started playing Tennis and loving it so far. Problem solving excites me and lead me to end up as software engineer. I love all kinds of music and live concerts.


My favourite character is [Rick Sanchez](images/img.jpg)
